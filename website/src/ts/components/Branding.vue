				<h3 id="General-logo-guidelines">General logo guidelines</h3>
				<p>These general guidelines apply for all artwork described in the next sections.</p>

				<h5 if="Respect-the-design">Respect the design</h5>
				<p>
					Respect the work that has been put into this design and the people that have made it. Use the logo artwork exactly as it’s given.
					Do not make up a logo yourself and do not manipulate it. Do not change the type, the colors, or the rules around it. Do not redraw it, distort it, or add anything to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to make something using the logo (e.g. 3D print, lasercut, etc) respect the dimensions of the logo:
				</p>
				<img src="/resources/branding-resources/construction.png">

				<h5 if="Clear-space-and-sizing">Clear space and sizing</h5>
				<p>
					The minimum clear space is defined as x, defined as one fourth of the width of the logo. 
					The minimum clear space of x should always be applied. Try to maximize clear space whenever possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					The minimum size of our logo is 98 px on screen, or 0,327 in (8,316 mm) in print. 
					In exceptional circumstances, smaller sizes for print may be necessary (e.g. on event merchandise). 
					In such cases, legibility should always be your top priority – always ensure the line in every object logomark and slogan are clearly visible.
				</p>
				<img src="/resources/branding-resources/clear_space.png">

				<h5 id="Colors">Colors</h5>
				<p>
					The SteemMakers logo can be color, dark or light. The used colors are detailed below. 
					Don't use the eyedropper, the ‘eye dropper’ or color sampling tool is inaccurate. For best color reproduction, follow the numbers in the color guidelines.
				</p>
				<img src="/resources/branding-resources/colors1.png">
				<img src="/resources/branding-resources/colors2.png">

				<h5 id="Placement">Placement</h5>
				<p>
					The logos should be used on all external communications and on internal communications that need a more formal approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					Give the logo its space. This is one of the most important things we’d like you to remember. 
					This space is always required on print pieces. If you’re creating a composition, put the SteemMakers logo in one of the areas. 
					Some examples can be found below.
				</p>
				<img src="/resources/branding-resources/placement.png">

				<h5 id="Background">Background</h5>
				<p>
					Ideally the logo is to be used on a light background for maximum impact and clarity.
					When this is not possible, be sure to choose background colors or photos that provide sufficient contrast with the logo.
					There is also an official background available in the resources below.
				</p>
